Interactive instructional techniques that engage students in higher order ‘thinking’ and investigation, through the use of interviews, focused group discussions, debates, projects, presentations, experiments, practicum, internship and application of ICT resources are important considerations. It also probes into the adequacy, competence as well as the continuous professional development of the faculty who handle the programmes of study. The efficiency of the techniques used to continuously evaluate the performance of teachers and students is also a major concern of this Criterion.</small>

                                                The student-teacher ratio has been found to be one of the strongest indicators of student success and engagement. Logically, it's little wonder why. The fewer students each teacher works with, the more closely they're able to adapt their teaching to the specific learning styles. They're also able to develop healthy one-on-one mentoring relationships and offer insight and help in ways that would be impossible in a larger classroom. Additionally, a lower ratio will lighten the workload for teachers, enabling them to focus on the quality rather than the quantity of their teaching and grading.

One of the purposes of evaluation is to provide development-inducing feedback. The qualitative dimension of evaluation is in its use for enhancing the competence of students. Innovative evaluation process is to gauge the knowledge and skills acquired at various levels of the programmes.

The real test of the extent to which teaching learning has been effective in a HEI is reflected in the student performance in the examinations. Student performance is seen as the realization of learning outcomes which are specifications of what a student should be capable of doing on successful completion of a course and/or a programme.

All the efforts of teachers and the institution to make learning a meaningful process can be considered impactful only to the extent students perceive it to be meaningful. Their satisfaction level is decided by the kinds of experiences they undergo, the extent of the “comfort” feeling as well as intellectual stimulation the learning situations provide. Their feedback significantly showcases the actual quality of teaching learning process enabling identification of the strengths of teaching as well as the possible improvements. Student satisfaction, thus, is a direct indicator of the effectiveness of teaching learning in the institution. It may be impractical to capture this aspect from every student; however, every HEI can resort to a sample survey on a formalized basis to capture this significant feature. This is the reason the revised assessment framework of NAAC adopts survey of student satisfaction.
